# Joyance's Blog <sup>NEWEST</sup>
I have started writing my blogs for a while. There are ~~lots of~~ articles and versions that i can't hold. So I decided to develop this project to tidy them.this may take long time to bild for me because I'm not master on code editing ðŸ˜‡. [^1]

### plan
- [x] ðŸŽ‰copy my old articles into there
- [ ] change article access method
- [ ] change home page animation

[^1]: whitout my friends: Cloude\Chat-GPT and so on.
